## Tasks Completed

### Level 1
#### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Explored the dataset to identify the number of rows and columns.
- Checked and handled missing values.
- Performed data type conversions.
- Analyzed the distribution of the target variable (`Aggregate Rating`) and identified class imbalances.

#### 2. Descriptive Analysis
- Calculated basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.
- Explored distributions of categorical variables such as `Country Code`, `City`, and `Cuisines`.
- Identified top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.

#### 3. Geospatial Analysis
- Visualized restaurant locations on a map using latitude and longitude.
- Analyzed the distribution of restaurants across different cities or countries.
- Explored correlations between location and ratings.

### Level 2
#### 1. Table Booking and Online Delivery
- Determined the percentage of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery.
- Compared the average ratings of restaurants with and without table booking.
- Analyzed online delivery availability across different price ranges.

#### 2. Price Range Analysis
- Identified the most common price range among restaurants.
- Calculated the average rating for each price range.
- Analyzed the color representing the highest average rating among price ranges.

#### 3. Feature Engineering
- Extracted additional features from existing columns, such as the length of restaurant names.
- Encoded categorical variables to create new features like `Has Table Booking` or `Has Online Delivery`.

### Level 3
#### 1. Predictive Modeling
- Built regression models to predict `Aggregate Rating` based on features.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets, evaluating performance using appropriate metrics.
- Experimented with multiple algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) and compared results.

#### 2. Customer Preference Analysis
- Analyzed relationships between cuisine types and ratings.
- Identified popular cuisines based on customer votes.
- Examined cuisines receiving higher ratings.

#### 3. Data Visualization
- Created visualizations to represent ratings distribution using histograms and bar plots.
- Compared average ratings of different cuisines and cities.
- Visualized relationships between various features and the target variable.
